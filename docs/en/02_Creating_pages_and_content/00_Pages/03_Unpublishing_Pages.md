title: Unpublishing pages
summary: Removing pages from the website without deleting the draft content.
introduction: If you want to temporarily remove a page from your website, for example if you accidentally click Publish too soon, or if the page is no longer required on your website, but will be again in the future, you can Unpublish it.

## Unpublishing pages

1. Select the page you want to unpublish, click the button ***More options*** which is shown as a ellipses icon in the Publishing bar.
2. Select the option **Unpublish** and the page will be removed from the site.
3. You can add any required changes, and click the button ***Save*** which will save those changes without making the page live.
4. Click the button ***Publish*** when you want to republish the page to the live version again.

### How do I know which pages have been unpublished?

Pages that exist as drafts, but are not yet published, will be marked with a **Draft** label in the site tree. When you create a new page, it will only exist as a Draft, until you click the button ***Publish***.

If you have no plans to re-publish the page in the near future, you can **Unpublish and archive** and recover the page at a later date, see [Restoring archived pages](restoring_archived_pages) to learn more.


<div class="note" markdown="1">In some circumstances, unpublished pages may still be visible on the website to admin users whilst they are logged in.  If unpublished pages are still appearing, check the site as a non-admin user or whilst not logged in to ensure that pages have been updated as expected.  See the section on [Previewing Changes](https://userhelp.silverstripe.org/en/4/creating_pages_and_content/creating_and_editing_content/previewing_changes/#previewing-changes) for more information.</div>
