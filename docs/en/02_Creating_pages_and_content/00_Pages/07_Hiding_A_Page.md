# Hiding a Page

## Hiding pages (hide from menus and search)

 1. Navigate to the **Pages** section within the CMS menu and select a page to enter edit mode.
 2. Navigate to the ***Settings*** tab.
 3. Next to the **Visibility** field, unselect the ***Show in menus?*** checkbox field. This will stop the page appearing in your website navigation menus.

 Note: You can see which pages are hidden by the page names colored grey in the site tree.


 4. Beside the **Visibility** field, unselect the ***Show in search?*** checkbox field to stop the page from appearing in search engine results.

 Note: If you are changing the search visibility on an existing page, it may take a few weeks for the page to disappear from search engine results.


 5. Click the button ***Publish***.

Only people who have access to the full page URL will be able to find the page. However, you can still link to the page from other pages, see [Insert Link](../creating_and_editing_content/inserting_links) to learn more.

<div class="note" markdown="1">You can either choose to hide the page from the menus or from search engines, you do not need to do both.</div>
