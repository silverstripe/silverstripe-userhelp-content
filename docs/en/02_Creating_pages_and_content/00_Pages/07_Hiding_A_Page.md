# Hiding a Page

## Hiding pages (menus and search)

1. Navigate to the **Pages** section within the CMS menu and select a page to enter edit mode.
2. Navigate to the ***Settings*** tab.
3. Next to the **Visibility** field, unselect the ***Show in menus?*** checkbox field. This will stop the page appearing in your website navigation menus.
4. Beside the **Visibility** field, unselect the ***Show in search?*** checkbox field to stop the page from appearing in search engine results.
If you are changing the search visibility on an existing page, it may take a few weeks for the page to disappear from search engine results.
5. Click the button ***Publish***.

> [!NOTE]
> You can see which pages are hidden by the page names colored grey in the site tree.

Only people who have access to the full page URL will be able to find the page. However, you can still link to the page from other pages, see [Inserting links](../creating_and_editing_content/inserting_links) to learn more.
