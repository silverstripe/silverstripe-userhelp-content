summary: Previewing changes before publishing
introduction: If you've made some substantial changes to a page, and want to check exactly how it looks before making the changes live, you can save the changes to a Draft and preview it.

This will allow you to view a preview of your draft/live content alongside the Navigation toolbar. That way you can make updates and see the preview immediately.

## Viewing the site in draft mode

In addition to previewing content within the CMS preview panel, it is also possible to preview the site from the 'front-end' (ie. as a visitor would see it).  Clicking on the URL segment in the CMS will open a new window containing the page being edited.  Code is added to the end of the URL (`stage=Stage`) which tells SilverStripe to show draft content.
