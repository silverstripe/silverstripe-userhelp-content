You can either:

> Some data doesn't have draft and published states. When editing data like that you might instead see the simple ***Preview*** state.

## Previewing your changes

1. Click the button ***Save*** in the publishing bar.
2. Click the ***Edit mode*** toggle and select the option **Split mode**.

This will allow you to view a preview of your draft/live content alongside the Navigation toolbar. That way you can make updates and see the preview immediately.

## Viewing the site in draft mode

In addition to previewing content within the CMS preview panel, it is also possible to preview the site from the 'front-end' (ie. as a visitor would see it).  Clicking on the URL segment in the CMS will open a new window containing the page being edited.  Code is added to the end of the URL (`stage=Stage`) which tells Silverstripe CMS to show draft content.
