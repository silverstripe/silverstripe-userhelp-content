summary: Adding video and other media to your content.

# Embedding media

To add media such as a video into a page, you should first upload it to a video hosting service such as YouTube or Vimeo. This means they will take care of everything involved in insuring the video will play on a wide range of devices such as computers, tablets & mobile devices.

YouTube allows you to mark a video as **Unlisted** so that it will not appear on YouTube.com search results etc. Also adverts will not be displayed on your video unless you enable that option from within YouTube.

<div class="note" markdown="1">This feature isn't just limited to video, you can also embed Flickr slideshows and other embeddable widgets this way, if they support the 'oEmbed' standard.</div>

You can upload your video to one of the supported media services (many of the [services that support oEmbed](http://oembed.com/#section7) protocol can be handled in this way):
* YouTube
* Twitter
* Flickr
* Vimeo
* Viddler
* Revision3
* Hulu
