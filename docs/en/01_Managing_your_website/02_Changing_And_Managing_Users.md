In the **New Member** section, you can edit the user's details. The two most important parts of the user's details are the email (which is also used for logging in) and password.

[note]
By default, an email address can only be used once in the system. It is not possible for multiple users to share the same email address.

[note]
Users can be in multiple groups. If you delete a user from a group, they are only removed from that group, not from the system. To fully delete a user from the system, you need to be in the root of Security.

Click the link ***Security*** in the breadcrumbs or click the button ***Back*** which is shown as a left arrow icon.

## Changing a user's password

To change a user's password, navigate to the ***Users*** tab, and select the user you would like to edit.

Click the link ***Change password*** to expand a password field and a confirm password field. Change the password (password entered must match) and confirm the change by clicking the button ***Save***.

## Managing and deleting users

To edit a user entry click on the item you want to edit from the list. To delete a user click the button ***Delete*** which is shown as a trash icon on either the list view or on the editable view for a user.
